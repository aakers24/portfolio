

Come up with and get a domain name
    - Set up the domain and hosting





-------- NON-ESSENTIAL OR POSSIBLE FUTURE CHANGES --------

Add a section (in about me?) about goals and things I foresee needing to improve on



Maybe remove scroll drop-shadow and/or make it different color depending on bg color / location ?
    - Possibly put a circle behind it



Make the menu button stay on the screen at every scroll position



Improve mobile design



make the photo grid more creative (?)
    - Add some more vertical photos and vary sizes
    - Less uniform grid
    - On click and/or mouseover show a larger view of picture



background-image: linear gradient? - Probably not, but keep in mind



Security Cerificate?
    - Probably unnecessary as there is no sensitive data being sent to or from users
