                <h2>My Computer Science and Systems Journey</h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>The journey of my learning in CSS has been filled with ups and downs, but ultimately I am at a point where I am confident in my knowledge and abilities and proud of what I have accomplished. When I first began, I was at Tacoma Community College and took CS142 and CS143 which were the intro programming courses. These classes built a strong foundation for the rest of my learning and especially built confidence in me. I did well in the classes and spent a lot of time helping classmates that were struggling. This not only helped me build confidence and soft skills, but gave me a lot of extra experience with programming and problem solving as I was coming up with different ways of explaining things and approaching problems. This ended up helping me as I moved to UW because the different approaches had different strengths such as optimality, efficiency, intuitiveness, and creativity. Some of the early projects I worked on in these stages were a 2d chess game application and a very rudimentary photo editing application.</p>
                <!-- <br/> -->
                <p>At this point my learning split into different areas such as systems and algorithms. I enjoyed and excelled at the systems courses that dealt with low-level principles like the underlying electrical engineering, machine code, assembly, programming languages, and operating systems. The algorithms courses that dealt with discrete structures, data structures, and algorithm design and analysis were less interesting to me, but I still performed well in them and they were classes that taught me important concepts and gave me valuable experience.</p>
                <!-- <br/> -->
                <p>Things were all brought together in classes like AI and Cryptography. These classes were ones I really enjoyed and they allowed me to apply much of my previously gained knowledge to engineering and developing software that was interesting and exciting to me. I got to come up with some projects on my own which allowed me to apply concepts to something I created. This allowed me to apply what I'd learned in all my different classes in a way that put those ideas into context. This was exciting for me because when the concepts I didn't enjoy as much when they were the sole focus of a class were now more engaging and enjoyable for me because they were doing their job in a larger system. I was able to exercise my managerial skills working with groups of peers and got valuable experience with source control in software development.</p>
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h2>IS&T Experience</h2>
            <p>After graduating I began job seeking while continuing to educate myself. Initially I was looking for Software Engineering and Developer roles, but I realized that what I really wanted to do was Cybersecurity. I continued working on all sorts of projects and experiments and continuing my learning in many different areas. I eventually landed a job as an End User Compute Engineer in the Information Systems and Technology department of Multicare Health System. During this time, I started out working at the MHS IS&T tech building working on things such as wiping, imaging, and repairing hardware, working remote and admin tickets, and some asset management tasks and projects. After that, I primarily worked at Tacoma General Hospital as an EUC tech. This was a contract position that helped me gain invaluable experience. It allowed me to gain a large amount of confidence and apply so much of my knowledge and ability to real world systems and structures in a company that does important, impactful work. This position afforded me the ability to observe many concepts taking place in a real setting, and I was especially drawn to those relating to security as that's where my focus was. I constantly thought about how different technologies and policies affected the security posture of the organization or how they could be exploited by attackers or hardened by defenders. One that I thought about all the time was tailgating as people would tailgate off of other employees badge swipes very frequently. It showed me how much I knew and exposed me to more by introducing some new things, but also giving me more depth of knowledge through application and experience.</p>
            <p>I was then hired on as a full time employee and took over as the sole EUC tech for the Allenmore Area. This area consists of Allenmore Hospital, Wellfound Behavioral Health Hospital, and dozens of other clinics and locations across Tacoma, Lakewood, Spanaway, and Parkland. Some of these locations were unqiue cases as they are joint ventures and require special attention to detail in order to meet their requirements. Being the only tech for the area requires incorporating different skillsets and taking on different roles while switching between management, customer service, and technician mindsets. I was also assigned a company vehicle to use and manage. I continued to use this as an opportunity to grow in ways both within and beyond the scope of the role itself. I took it upon myself to cross train with other teams, especially Network and Endpoint Engineering. I made it a point to do as much of the other jobs as I could when I came in contact with them to help broaden my experience and understanding of the different technologies, methodologies, and structure of the systems and organization. It was also during this time that I took a Microsoft Configuration Manager class, earned Dell hardware certifications, and earned my Security+.</p>

                <h2>My Cybersecurity Journey</h2>
                <p>While I was working through my degree in CSS my curiousity and compulsion to understand how things work drove me to learn about many things that were only partially touched by or entirely outside the scope of my coursework. These things included a more in-depth understanding of Computer Engineering and hardware, Electrical Engineering concepts, Networking, Graphics, and more.</p>
                <p>Cybersecurity was one of these topics and I was captivated by multiple aspects of it. One such captivating aspect is that it greatly rewards low-level understanding of the concepts which are very diverse in nature. These concepts cover everything from low-level engineering all the way to high-level design and even cover human behavior and psychology. There are also different approaches one can take to being a participant in Cybersecurity. One of the main distinctions between approaches is Red/Blue team (offensive/defensive security) and if you have the dedication and desire you can do it all. Finally, one of the most important aspects of Cybersecurity that captives me is that it can be extremely impactful. Learning and growing in the field creates insights and opportunities that can have a massive effect on lives. This impact is something that makes both the processes of building my skillset and utilizing it very meaningful and fulfilling for me.</p>
                <p>While completing my degree, I began studying and practicing Cybersecurity. I used a variety of resources and at first getting into even the most trivial content was a challenge because it was hard to find quality resources for learning. There was a very small volume compared to other computer science topics and this was especially true as the quality of the resources increased. I also found that the practice content wasn't geared toward someone with no knowledge on the topics. One of the practice websites, Hack The Box, even required you to "hack" your way in. Despite the difficulty, I began figuring things out and that difficulty became a boon because every time I conquered a challenge that seemed impossible I was elated and motivated to keep going. It was also very gratifying because deep-down I knew I was learning skills that had a potential to be used maliciously, but at the same time that meant they could be used to stop that malicious behavior. It felt like I was earning a place in a niche part of society where that skillset really matters and can be used to make an impact doing great things.</p>
                <p>After I graduated I worked on quite a few projects, including this portfolio website, but some of the projects that I enjoyed most, was most driven to complete, or meant the most to me were the Cybersecurity projects. I've spent tons of time studying, learning, and growing in Cybersecurity and I believe it's something that will always be a part of me and my life.</p>

                    <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Obstruction is a game in which each player tries to be the last person to make a move. A move is made by placing your piece in a position on the board. When a position is occupied by a player's piece, none of the adjacent positions on the board can be occupied. So, if it's your turn and there is no place remaining for you to legally place your piece, you lose.
                        <br/><br/>
                        The project is a console application in which an AI plays against a human player in a game of Obstruction. I implemented the project in such a way that with small tweaks the board size and look-ahead can be changed. This means that the board size can theoretically be arbitrarily large, and the look-ahead of the AI can be arbitrarily long. The look-ahead is how many turns the AI looks into the future to make its move.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        The AI uses a Minimax algorithm to look into the future and see the possible moves that could be made given the current board state. It uses a function to estimate the best move and makes it.
                        <br/><br/>
                        However, as the board size and/or look-ahead distance increases this becomes very computationally expensive and quickly becomes unplayable due to the time it takes for the AI to consider it's moves. Because of this, there is an option to use an Alpha-Beta Pruning Minimax algorithm. This does mostly the same thing as the Minimax algorithm, but avoids unnecessary calculations by determining if an optimal solution has already been found. This greatly increases the usability of the AI as the board size and/or look-ahead distance increases.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Importance</h2>
                    <p>
                        What makes this one of my best works is that I went the extra mile to make the finished product work well and scale easily. It is a fun game and the AI will indeed beat me. Working on this project really helped me understand AI, and working to make it scale to an arbitrary board size was a challenge which really helped me get the most out of the project. It was very rewarding playing against the AI on all the different board sizes and look-ahead levels as well as with and without AB-Pruning because it showed the efficacy of my skills and the optimality of my result.

                        The Fibonacci Sequence is a pattern of numbers that has various applications in mathematics and other fields. In general the Nth number in the sequence is the sum of the 2 before it. So for example 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, and so on.

                        <br/><br/>
                        The special part about this specific program that makes it one of my highlights is that the professor pulled it up and used it as an example of an excellent solution.

                    <p>
                        Cybersecurity is a very important part of life on the internet. With so much data about us on computers, there is an opportunity for that data to be viewed, changed, corrupted, or otherwise interacted with by people who have bad intentions or just shouldn't have the ability to do so. Through the basic cybersecurity services confidentiality, integrity, authentication(legitimacy, non-repudiation), and availability(this one cannot be done with cryptography) we assure that our data stays safe.
                    </p>
                    <br/>

                    <h2>Implementation</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this project, I implemented a program which allows for hashing, encrypting, decrypting, tagging, signing, and verifying data. The SHA3 derived KMACXOF256 function is used prominently in this project. For encrypting and decrypting, there are options to use both the symmetric algorithms and elliptic curve algorithms. The primary method of passing data in is through files although there are text input functionalities available. If I were to continue development of this project I would make it more robust and user-friendly, as the focus of the project was the functionality of the cryptography.

                    <h2>Importance</h2>
                    <p>
                        To me this project was very important because as I said in the Who I Am section of the home page, I am driven by the need to know how things work. This project was very special to me because it allowed me to implement the standardized cryptography functions by myself and at the end I had a program that I wrote which could perform the basic cryptographic cybersecurity services. I'm very proud of this because that means that in the future if I want to ensure the security of something I'm working on, I've proven that I can do that myself and I don't have to rely on someone else to do that for me. At the very least it means I understand how the concepts work and makes me feel more secure in my future work, no matter the focus. I also got a lot of practice with software development, implementing things based on standards, working between different languages, and source control.
